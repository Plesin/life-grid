# Life Grid - Stop Wasting Time!!

## Visualize your Life in boxes

[live app](https://life-grid.rapl.eu/)

I got the inspiration for this web page in a youtube video [6 Reasons to Retire as Soon as You Can](https://youtu.be/OuDCDp9Z9Y4?si=F0EkUL6OsIi4EvBP&t=70) recorded by [@JamesShack. I highly recommend watching this video.

James mentions in the video the original source of his inspiration, which is [waitbutwhy](https://waitbutwhy.com/) blog.

Specifically these are very interesting and worth reading:

- [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)
- [100 Blocks a Day](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html)
- [Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html)

As James mentions in his video, Time is one of the most precious assets we have in life.
Therefore it's a very good idea to watch out and visualize how we spend it.

I wanted to have a simple dynamic way how to draw the boxes based on a birth day and compare it to some of the data used in both resources.

### June 2025 update

Accidentally came across this video [ WE LEARN IT TOO LATE: You’re Wasting the Only Life You’ll Ever Have (4,000 Weeks)- Oliver Burkeman ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4kiuuiSdzU) where my favorite youtube author [Dr Rangan Chatterjee](https://www.youtube.com/@DrChatterjeeRangan) hosts the author of [Four thousand weeks](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourthousandweeks) where they discuss the very same topic. Interesting video, need to read the book.
